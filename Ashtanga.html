        <P>The word Ashtanga is comprised of two Sanskrit words, “Ashta” and “Anga.” “Ashta” refers to the number eight,
            while “Anga” means limb or body part. Therefore, Ashtanga is the union of the eight limbs of yoga, into one
            complete, holistic system. These eight-limbs of yoga represent the various branches of the philosophy of the
            yoga sutras that form the foundation in the Ashtanga Yoga School. The Ashtanga philosophy is to integrate
            all of the eight limbs of yoga, which include: Yama (moral codes), Niyama (self-discipline), Asana
            (posture), Pranayama (breath control), Pratyahara (sense withdrawal), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana
            (meditation), and Samadhi (oneness with the self).</P>
